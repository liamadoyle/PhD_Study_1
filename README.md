## About
For the first study of my dissertation, I conducted several meta-analyses examining the relationship between psychopathy and exploitative behaviours in economic games. Specifically, this relationship was examined in five major economic games: the Prisoner's Dilemma Game, the Public Goods Game, the Dictator Game, the Ultimatum Game, and the Trust Game. Several conceptual and methodological moderators were examined (e.g., *k*-index of game, incentive structures of the study). Lastly, the relationship between psychopathy and success in economic games was examined. Due to a lack of data in other games, this solely involved examining this relationship within the Prisoner's Dilemma Game.
